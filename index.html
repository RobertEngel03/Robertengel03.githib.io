          Im currently a senior at CSI getting my degree in computer science im leaning towards the fields of being a 
          software engineer, Cyber Security Specialist or Game Developer.I first learned about computer science from a clue credit meeting in CSI I was actually the only one there

          I love the art and passion that goes into developing,I have that childhood dream of making a game for people to enjoy and talk about
        really gave me that Ah Ha! momment that this field is for me. I cant wait to continue my journey to improve my Computer science skills and Experience.
