      Robert Engel is currently a Computer Science Major receiving his Bachelor’s in Science at the College of Staten Island. In high school, Robert was a performer. He danced, played the drums and guitar, sang, acted in plays, and would draw and doodle. He also from the youngest age was a gamer. Robert struggled with ADHD most of his life and pouring into the arts and video games helped him take control of his mind and gave him purpose.

      Entering into college, Robert struggled with what path to take. After sitting in an informational session about his current major, he immediately was hooked. After being in the major for a little over 2 years now he every day is finding more ways to include his artistic passions into what he develops as a Computer Scientist. He loves the creativity that goes into Comp Sci. One day he would love to create games that he wish he was able to play when he was younger.

      He is currently leaning towards becoming a Software Engineer, Cybersecurity Specialist or a Game Developer. He can’t wait to continue his journey, improve his skills and gain experience in this field.
